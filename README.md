## My process

- At first I wrote necessary `html` code to structure the website.
- Then I wrote necessary `css` styles for the navigation menu at first, then for other home elements.
- Then I wrote necessary `js` code to toggle the navigation menu on mobile-devices.
- Also I wrote necessary `js` code for the watch swiper/slider.
- Moreover, I wrote necessary `js` code for onLand (at first sight) animations.
- Finally, I wrote necessary _CSS Media Queries_ for the optimal view on different devices.

### Built with
